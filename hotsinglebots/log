- FIXME at very top relates to /api/MathSquared/model/model.json and model.hdf5
- Oh, it's TensorFlow. ohhhhh
- Wrote [get_model]
- Got model 07204545
- Started swiping
- 'The bot can't see you.' Oh I need a prof pic
- Got model 702; same...
- More swiping; 'The bot doesn't like you back.'
- Wrote [model.py]
- Okay, hdf5 definitely stores the weights of the model described in json
- There's only one model; scrap directories and move it all up

- Console: 'Current bot prefers a _' oooh... so we want it to match a certain thing
- Let's load up the TF model
- Looks like Keras is how you do it [brain.py:main,get_model]

- Now, what do I feed into the model...
- The model is a Sequential, and there was an issue loading optimizer state
- Let's look at model.json but as a [model.yaml]
- Input is 32x32x3, output is a number which maps into constants.js [brain.py:classes]
- Finish model [brain.py:get_image]
- Hints: it wants an automobile
- Run recursively on all .jpg/.png in ~/Pictures [pictures]
- No automobiles? Wha
- Okay... MORE BRUTE FORCE [brain.py:classify_images]
- Downloaded Delorean images [deloreans:0-19]
- Let's try different interps! Still no

- Automobile is usually the lowest score; we need to bring it up
- Let's get all scores!

- Maybe it's the car emoji on this channel? [deloreans/car*] No
- Maybe it's a favicon? [favicons]

- Time to create the image! SIMULATED ANNEALING BABY [sim_anneal.py] [results.png] naw screw this

- Maybe this? http://web.mit.edu/profit/PDFS/DuaA.pdf https://papers.nips.cc/paper/310-closed-form-inversion-of-backpropagation-networks-theory-and-optimization-issues.pdf
- ohhhhh https://blog.keras.io/how-convolutional-neural-networks-see-the-world.html [backprop.py]
- YAY IT WORKED [picture.png]


GOT IT
