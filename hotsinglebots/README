This is the workspace I used to solve problem #4, hotsinglebots.

Files I mentioned in the writeup:
- model.hdf5, model.json: the model files downloaded from the site.
- model.py: the program that loaded the model files and opened a REPL.
- brain.py: the code that imported and ran the model.
- deloreans, favicons: directories containing sample images that I classified in failing attempts to find the correct image online.
- sim_anneal.py: the failed attempt at simulated annealing.
- backprop.py: the backpropagation code that finally worked.
- picture.png: the correct solution.

Files I've omitted:
- *.pyc (files deleted).
- deloreans/*, favicons/*: for copyright reasons, and also because they're huge (emptied out the directories).
- model.hdf5: the 10 MB binary containing the model weights (contents replaced with 'File removed, see README').
- result.png: the result of my failed simulated annealing solution attempt (contents replaced with 'File removed, see README').

Files I've modified:
- pictures: the result of running the model on all images in ~/Pictures (censored the precise filenames of images, and removed the debug view of exact model scores at the beginning).
