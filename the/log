- Drill, notice React and "title" on stuff
- Length of title is 5x length of output (11, 55); 12 shorter than input length, 2 shorter w/v spaces (first row)
- Component posts to /api/decode
- BUT THERE ARE AS MANY WORDS!
- Lot of error reading...
- It seems order-independent. Progress.
- The title code is A=0, Z=25, space=26.
- Plenty of misspellings; shitty codebook or something else?
- Subbed a codeword from one place to another, flipped a bit!
- [ciphers]
- reelect/isnt
- Places they modify align (both at 10)
- reelect in 12th when sorting by reversed key
- reelect is 10th in sorted order of keywords, but isnt lands in sixth
- Sorting by sum of letter codes yields nothing useful, though one of them is in tenth position in the original string
- Neither does xoring sum of codes in word, or adding mod 27 or 26

We know:
- Order doesn't matter
- Each word corresponds to a letter and a position

- Created [decode.py:decode,decode_of,main], [base.py:seqdiff,place_in_all]
- Let's try and see what's assigned to what [study.py:get_pairs]
- Found some data [known], wrote [study.py:format_pairs]
- Maybe it's a codebook... wrote [study.py:attempt_uncover]
- QoL: [:main]
- Let's build an engine... [:attempt_uncover:basis,lower] [:attempt_uncover_all]

- Does it involve system words? No, deloreon isn't in /usr/share/dict/words, even if we ignore case and apostrophes
- Are they actual words? Seem to be, 'b' isn't a word but 'i' is
- Is it from a text corpus? DeLoreon is BTTF
- OOOH OOOH "a better car with ... price" https://sfy.ru/transcript/back_to_the_future_ts
- Is this canon? http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/backtothefuture_transcript.txt
- [bttf.py] [bttf] (had to change len(ENCODE) to 32)
- Makes sense, big words mostly at back + 'deloreon', 'nickles' confirms it
