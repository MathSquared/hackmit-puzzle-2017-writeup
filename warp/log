- Loaded warp
- Noticed seems like simple cipher
- Filled to [table] and extrapolated
- Created [fixstring] to decrypt strings
- Noticed link; decrypted to [great_scott]
- Downloaded to [WarpCLI/great_scott.jar] (named after class inside)
- Downloaded Java 8 (jessie-backports openjdk-8-jdk)
- Ran

WarpCLI$ java -jar great_scott.jar
It's not your time ;)
WarpCLI$

- Copied to WarpCLI2, unzipped
- Viewed javaps [WarpCLI2/javap-WarpCLI.java] [WarpCLI2/javap-WarpCLI$1.java]

[ Looked at GA script [warp_js]; just GA ]

- Viewed javaps -c [WarpCLI2/javap-WarpCLI[$1]]
- Viewed xxd WarpCLI [WarpCLI2/xxd-WarpCLI-orig]
- CRUCIAL OBSERVATION: 25 and 33 of javap are ifeq (99)
- Changed to ifne (9a) [WarpCLI2/xxd-WarpCLI]
- Moved [WC2/WarpCLI.class] -> [WC2/WarpCLI-orig.class]
- xxd -r to [WC2/WarpCLI.class]
- Still no...
- Fine. goto (a7)
- Breaks, stack canary
- Let's try and find where it breaks... change first back to 99
- [run]
- Explodes at 33... progress
- Change second to 99 or 9a, neither works
- Using jdb, figured out must be 9a then 99 [answer]

GOT IT
